# Configuration

You have a flecks application! ...but it doesn't do much. By default, your application will have
only three flecks: `@flecks/build`, `@flecks/core`, and `@flecks/server`. Your `build/flecks.yml`
file will look like this:

```yml title="build/flecks.yml"
'@flecks/core':
  id: 'hello-world'
'@flecks/server': {}
```

Each fleck may have configuration that can be set through `build/flecks.yml`. For a deep dive of
configurable core flecks, see [the generated configuration page](./flecks/config).

## `build/flecks.yml`

Your flecks application stores its build configuration in a directory located at `build`. By
default, there is a single file located there: `flecks.yml`. This is where all the individual
flecks are configured.

Your application's ID is configured at the `id` key of `@flecks/core`'s configuration:

```yml title="build/flecks.yml"
// highlight-start
'@flecks/core':
  id: 'hello-world'
// highlight-end
'@flecks/server': {}
```

Notice that the ID was set automatically by the app creation utility.

## Moving forward

In the next section, we'll look at how to create a fleck.
