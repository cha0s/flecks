# Electron

flecks provides integration with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) through
`@flecks/electron`.

:::note[Gotta have somewhere to go]

`@flecks/web` will automatically give Electon somewhere to go. Otherwise you must define
`@flecks/electron.url`.

:::

In development, `@flecks/electron` will run your server application using the Electron binary
instead of node.

If `@flecks/react` or `@flecks/redux` are enabled in your application, the
[React DevTools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) or
[Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) extensions (respectively) will be
automatically installed.

:::info[Can't stop the signal]

`@flecks/create-app` automatically ships with a patch for Electron to fix a bug in their
signal-forwarding code. This is necessary to make sure HMR works in your application.

See: https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/40667
