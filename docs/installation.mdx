# Installation

The first step toward creating an application with flecks is to use the built-in
creation utility:

<Create type="app" pkg="hello-world" />

:::tip

You may also inspect the utility command options:

<Create headless type="app" pkg="-- --help" />

```
Usage: create-app [options] <app>

Arguments:
  app                             name of the app to create

Options:
  -pm,--package-manager <binary>  package manager binary (choices: "npm", "pnpm", "bun", "yarn")
  -h, --help                      display help for command
```

:::

## Start your application

Now, move into your new project directory and

<Run headless cmd="start" />

You'll see a bunch of output, but the important thing is the last line:

```
  @flecks/server/entry up! +7ms
```

That means we've got an application up and running!

## Do something interesting

The only problem is that it doesn't do a single
thing except sit there. Let's get into how to configure our application to do something interesting
and start working on creating a fleck of our own.
