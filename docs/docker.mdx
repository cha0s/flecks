description: Spin up containers and orchestrate your production application.

Integrate your application with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Spin up containers

`@flecks/docker` can spin up containers for rapid development.

:::warning

The user running the server must have Docker privileges.
See: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user

:::

Adding `@flecks/docker` to your `build/flecks.yml` will discover and spin up containers in
development. For instance, if you have `@flecks/db` in your `build/flecks.yml`, `@flecks/docker`
will automatically spin up a database.

See **Implementations** under
[the `@flecks/docker.containers` documentation](./flecks/hooks#flecksdockercontainers) to find
implementations of Docker containers.


`@flecks/docker` runs your container in a manner that outlives your application. If you kill your
application and then run:

```
docker ps
```

You will see lines for your containers looking something like:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                 CREATED        STATUS        PORTS                                      NAMES
<SOME_ID>      postgres  "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"  5 minutes ago  Up 5 minutes  0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, :::5432->5432/tcp  [FLECKS_ID]_sequelize
```

:::tip[What's in a name?]

The container name is based off of `@flecks/core.id` which by default is `flecks`. If you change
your application's ID, the container name will be different!

:::

You'll see under the `NAMES` column heading, there is an entry called `[FLECKS_ID]_sequelize`. That's
our database container! You can always

```
docker kill [FLECKS_ID]_sequelize
```

to free up any resources being used. flecks keeps the containers running so that you get a nice
fast application start.


## Build and orchestrate for production

`@flecks/docker` hooks the server build to include a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` to
both build and orchestrate your application with Docker.

By default, these will be found at `dist/server` after building your application.

After building, the application could be composed in Docker Compose using the following command:

```
docker-compose -f dist/server/docker-compose.yml up
```
