# Documentation

Ah, the most ~~boring~~ awesome part of development.

flecks provides a fleck called `@flecks/dox` that helps you generate documentation for your
project.

:::tip[Mmm, dog food]

In fact, this very website you're viewing uses the same tooling! Check out the
[Generated details page](./category/generated-details).

:::

## Install `@flecks/dox`

To get started, add `@flecks/dox` to your project:

<Execute cmd="flecks add -d @flecks/dox" />

## Output for Docusaurus

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) is a nice way to generate a documentation website.
`@flecks/dox` can output MDX files for Docusaurus:

<Execute headless cmd="flecks dox docusaurus" />

By default this command will output the files to `website/docs/flecks`.

As an example, this website defines an entry in `sidebars.js` like so:

```js
{
  type: 'category',
  label: 'Generated details',
  link: {
    type: 'generated-index',
  },
  items: [
    'flecks/hooks',
    'flecks/config',
    'flecks/build-files',
    'flecks/todos',
  ],
},
```

## Raw output

You may also output JSON files for your own processing:

<Execute headless cmd="flecks dox json" />

By default this command will output the files to `dist/dox`.
