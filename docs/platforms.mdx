description: It might matter where your code is running.

Platforms automatically discover flecks based on the platform where the code is running.

A fleck may provide a `/client` or `/server` path which is automatically included or excluded based
on the current platform.

:::tip[For example]

The `@flecks/react` fleck includes a `@flecks/react/client` and `@flecks/react/server` fleck. So
you can simply add `@flecks/react` to your `build/flecks.yml` and it will include everything
automatically for the server and client side.
