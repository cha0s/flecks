# Configuration

You have a flecks application! ...but it doesn't do much. This is because a flecks application is
composed of individual flecks and by default, your application will have only two flecks:
`@flecks/core` and `@flecks/server`. Your `build/flecks.yml` file will look like this:

```yml title="build/flecks.yml"
'@flecks/core': {}
'@flecks/server': {}
```

Each fleck may have configuration that can be set through `build/flecks.yml`.
For a deep dive of configurable core flecks, see
[the generated configuration page](/docs/flecks/@flecks/dox/config).

## `build/flecks.yml`

A good first configuration step is to set the ID of your application.

Your application's ID is configured at the `id` key of `@flecks/core`'s configuration. To set your
application's ID to `hello_world`, update your `build/flecks.yml` to look like this:

```yml title="build/flecks.yml"
// highlight-start
'@flecks/core':
  id: 'hello_world'
// highlight-end
'@flecks/server': {}
```

## Adding more

If you were studious enough to take a peek at [the generated configuration page](/docs/flecks/@flecks/dox/config)
above, you may have noticed that there were a lot more flecks there than just the two in our
application.

For instance, there is a `@flecks/web` fleck that turns your little old server application into one
that can build and serve a webpage. We'll see how to add it in the next section.
