# Electron

flecks provides integration with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) through
`@flecks/electron`.

:::note[Gotta have somewhere to go]

`@flecks/web` must be enabled on your site to give Electon somewhere to go.

:::

In development, `@flecks/electron` will run your server application using the Electron binary
instead of node.

If `@flecks/react` or `@flecks/redux` are enabled in your application, the
[React DevTools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) or
[Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) extensions (respectively) will be
automatically installed.

:::note

Production support including bundling is currently **in progress**. Maybe you would like to
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/cha0s/flecks/compare)?
