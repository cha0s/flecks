title: Creating a fleck
description: A fleck is a module but also so much more.

import Create from '@site/helpers/create';
import InstallPackage from '@site/helpers/install-package';

So you want to create a fleck. Think you got what it takes?

If you are following along from the previous getting started
[configuration page](./configuration), you have an application with 3 flecks:

- `@flecks/core`
- `@flecks/server`
- `@flecks/web`

<details>
  <summary>About that "3 flecks" thing...</summary>

  Actually, your application has 6 flecks at this point:

  - `@flecks/core`
  - `@flecks/core/server`
  - `@flecks/server`
  - `@flecks/server/server`
  - `@flecks/web`
  - `@flecks/web/server`

  flecks will load the `[...]/server` fleck under any fleck that is loaded on the server. This is
  also the case when using `@flecks/web` which will automatically load `[...]/client` flecks
  which are only loaded in the browser. We'll be exploring this specifically in the next section.
  If you're intersted in diving deeper, see [the platforms concept page](#todo).

  Some frameworks make it a little cheesier to work with isomorphic code, but the flecks
  philosophy is that visibility is believability: you'll have to be explicit about which code
  runs where.

## Your first fleck

Let's make your website greet the user with a good ol' **hello world**.

To do this, you'll be creating your own little fleck. flecks also provides a built-in utility to
create a fleck.

:::note

You may have noticed that your little starter application has a `packages` directory. By default,
flecks structures your application as a monorepo.

This isn't any hard requirement, it's only a suggestion.

:::

Let's create our little fleck:

<Create type="fleck" pkg="say-hello" />

After some output, you'll find your new fleck at `packages/say-hello`. There is a source file at
`packages/say-hello/src/index.js` but for now it's empty. Let's fill it out a bit:

```javascript
exports.hooks = {
  '@flecks/web/client.up': async () => {
    window.document.body.append('hello world');
  },
};
```

Good? Good! Now, let's add this to our `build/flecks.yml`:

```yml
'@flecks/core':
  id: 'hello_world'
'@flecks/server': {}
'@flecks/web': {}
// highlight-next-line
'@hello-world/say-hello:./packages/say-hello/src': {}
```

### Aliasing for the win

Notice there's a colon separating the path for this one. This is because this is an
[aliased fleck](#todo). The part before the colon is the alias and the part after is the
path to the package.

Now, restart your application and visit your website. Glorious, isn't it?

By the way, your other application code can import using the alias (e.g.
`require('@hello-world/say-hello');`)
[as if it were a package](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias).

<details>
  <summary>Wait, my flecks don't have to be in <code>node_modules</code>?</summary>

  Nope! When you're developing applications, it can be real nice to
  just pull in local source "packages". If you're wondering how this works, see
  [the alias concept page](#todo).

  You probably shouldn't do things like name an alias the same thing as a package that actually
  exists in your `node_modules` directory. This is mitigated if you use the default monorepo
  structure (unless your application name is identical to a monorepo organization that already
  exists on `npm`: don't do that).

  If you'd like to help define what happens in these edge cases you could
  always [submit a pull request](https://github.com/cha0s/flecks/compare). :smile:

  That being said, sharing your packages on npm is a cool thing to do, so be rad and share your
  awesome flecks with the rest of us!
</details>

## Everything so far... plus Electron!

Let's add another core fleck. flecks ships with a core fleck `@flecks/electron`. This runs your
application inside of an instance of [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). You'll add the fleck:

<InstallPackage pkg="@flecks/electron" />

Then you'll update your `build/flecks.yml` like so:

```yml
'@flecks/core':
  id: 'hello_world'
// highlight-start
'@flecks/electron': {}
'@flecks/server':
  up:
    - '...'
    - '@flecks/web'
    - '@flecks/electron'
// highlight-end
'@flecks/web': {}
'@hello-world/say-hello:./packages/say-hello/src': {}
```

### ~~flecking~~ pecking order

Did you notice we added some configuration to `@flecks/server`? The `up` key configures the order in
which flecks are initialized when the server comes up. We make sure `@flecks/web` serves a webpage
before `@flecks/electron` tries to visit it.

:::note

There are future plans to make this the default with no configuration required.

:::

Finally `npm start` and you should see something like this:

Isn't it beautiful? :relieved:
