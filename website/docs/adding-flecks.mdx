# Adding flecks

`@flecks/web` is a fleck that builds and serves a webpage. You can add it to your application
using flecks:

```bash
npx flecks add @flecks/web
```

Now, if you run `npm start`, you'll see a line in the output:

```
  @flecks/web/server/http HTTP server up @ 0.0.0.0:32340!
```

## Finally... a white page?

If you visit `localhost:32340` in your browser, you should now see... a blank white page! Don't fret
though; if you open the devtools in your browser, you will see a little messaging from your
application that will look something like:

```
[webpack-dev-server] Server started: Hot Module Replacement enabled, Live Reloading enabled, Progress disabled, Overlay enabled.
[HMR] Waiting for update signal from WDS...
flecks client v2.0.3 loading runtime...
```

This is a good sign! This means we successfully added a web server with HMR enabled by default.
Oh, the possibilities...

## Proceed with the hooking

How does flecks know to start the web server when the application starts? Great question! This is
accomplished through the use of hooks. You'll see how to configure that hook in the next section.

For now, we'll learn how to create our own fleck and do a little hooking of our own. Take that, dad!
