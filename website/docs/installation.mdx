import Create from '@site/helpers/create';

# Installation

The first step toward creating an application with flecks is to use the built-in
creation utility:

<Create type="app" pkg="hello-world" />

:::tip

You may also inspect the utility command options:

<Create type="app" pkg="--help" />

```
Usage: create-app [options] <app>

Arguments:
  app                         name of the app to create

Options:
  --package-manager <binary>  package manager binary (choices: "npm", "bun", "yarn", default: "npm")
```

:::

## Start your application

Now, move into your new project directory and run `npm start`. You'll see a bunch of output, but the
important thing is the last line:

```
  @flecks/server/entry up! +7ms
```

That means we've got an application up and running!

## Do something interesting

The only problem is that it doesn't do a single
thing except sit there. Let's get into how to configure our application to do something interesting
and start working on creating a fleck of our own.
