# Command-line interface

flecks has a command-line interface for building, linting, testing, and so much more.

## Built-in commands

### `build`

Build a target in your application.

```bash
flecks build --help
Usage: flecks build [options] [target]

Arguments:
  target               target (choices: "...")

Options:
  -d, --no-production  dev build
  -h, --hot            build with hot module reloading
  -w, --watch          watch for changes
```

### `lint`

```bash
Usage: flecks lint [options]

run linter
```

### `docusaurus`
(Implemented by `@flecks/dox`)

```bash
Usage: flecks docusaurus [options] <subcommand> [siteDir]

create a documentation website for this project

Arguments:
  subcommand  Docusaurus command to run (choices: "build", "create", "start")
  siteDir     Docusaurus directory (default: "website")
```

The `build` and `start` subcommands are sugar on top of the corresponding Docusaurus commands.

The `create` subcommand will create a documentation website starter template for you at `siteDir`
which defaults to `website` if `siteDir` doesn't already exist. A `docusaurus.config.js`
starter configuration will also be copied to your `build` directory, if it doesn't already exist.

## Your commands

You can implement your own command by implementing
[`@flecks/core.commands`](/docs/flecks/@flecks/dox/hooks#fleckscorecommands) in your fleck.
