# Documentation website

Ah, the most ~~boring~~ awesome part of development.

flecks provides a fleck called `@flecks/dox` that helps you generate a documentation website for
your project.

:::tip[Mmm, dog food]

In fact, this very website you're viewing now has been built with the same tooling!

:::

## Install `@flecks/dox`

To get started, add `@flecks/dox` to your project:

```bash
npx flecks add -d @flecks/dox
```

## Spin up a starter website

Next, run:

```bash
npx flecks docusaurus create
```

You should now have a starter configuration in `build/docusaurus.config.js` and a new directory
in your project: `website`. See [the command documentation](/docs/cli#docusaurus) to discover more
options.

Now, start your documentation website's development server with:

```
npx flecks docusaurus start
```

You should now see a message similar to:

```bash
[SUCCESS] Docusaurus website is running at: http://localhost:3000/
```

Go and have a look!

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Screenshot of the front page of the generated documentation site"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/flecks-dox-1-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/flecks-dox-1.png'),
    }}
  />
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Screenshot of the documentation introduction page of the generated documentation site"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/flecks-dox-2-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/flecks-dox-2.png'),
    }}
  />
</ImageRow>

Not bad, huh?

## Building it out

It's only a starter template, of course. You'll want to pop over to
[the Docusaurus guides page](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides) to build out your new
website. Have fun!

:::tip[Ready to roll out!]

When you're ready to build for production, just run

```bash
npx flecks docusaurus build
```

After successfully building, your website files will be located at `dist/dox`.
