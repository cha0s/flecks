# Documentation

Ah, the most ~~boring~~ awesome part of development.

flecks provides a fleck called `@flecks/dox` that helps you generate a documentation website for
your project. In fact, this very website you're viewing now has been built with the same tooling!

`@flecks/dox` implements a [CLI command](/flecks/docs/flecks/@flecks/dox/hooks#fleckscorecommands)
to run [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and generate a documentation site for your project.
