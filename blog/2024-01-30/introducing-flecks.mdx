Introducing flecks: an **exceptionally-extensible application production system**.

{/* truncate */}

## First off, :pray:

I appreciate you checking out the project! I truly hope that you will find working with flecks
to be a joy. Feedback is welcome over on the
[Github discussions page](https://github.com/cha0s/flecks/discussions) or the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/SH66yQBwNf)!

:::warning[What's the letter before "alpha"?]

This is a new release and worked on by only one person: [me](https://github.com/cha0s)! Please
keep this in mind!

## Is it ~~webscale~~ fullstack?

I admit, I baited with the title there just a little bit. I love fullstack! flecks is more
than capable of building fullstack applications. If you just want to jump to more of that sort
of thing, you might be interested in the <Link target="_blank" to="https://cha0s.github.io/flecks/docs/react">React</Link>
page in the documentation.

### For real, though

A fullstack JS application is basically appception: what you actually have is a server
application written in JS that serves a client application written in JS. Using
the same language obscures (arguably, *by design*) the fact that these are actually two distinct
applications.

![A screenshot of Doctor Olivia Octopus saying "There's two, actually"](./two-actually.jpg)

:::danger[`'use controversy';`]

Some modern framework APIs are becoming increasingly esoteric in their attempt to paper over
this reality
([*\*ahem\**](https://github.com/cha0s/flecks/blob/master/packages/react/src/client.js#L24)... and
don't get me started on [**RSC**](https://www.mayank.co/blog/react-server-components/)...).

:::

### Don't get it twisted

To put it in basic terms: A web server is a core aspect of a fullstack application, but **a
web server is not a core aspect of an application**. The same could be said about asset
optimization, routing, and many other core fullstack JS concepts.

flecks is concerned with **writing applications**; fullstack applications are merely a subset of
that.

## Do one thing and do it well

The core primitive is the **fleck** which is... just a JS module. There exists a server
fleck, a web fleck, a React fleck, and so on.

Here's a simple fleck that says hello when the application is starting:

```js
export const hooks = {
  '@flecks/core.starting': () => {
    console.log('hey you');
  },
};
```

That's it. It's a module that exports some hook implementations. If you're curious what kind of
hooks we're talking about, check out
<Link target="_blank" to="https://cha0s.github.io/flecks/docs/flecks/hooks">the hooks reference page</Link>.

You add a reference to your fleck to a file called
<Link target="_blank" to="https://cha0s.github.io/flecks/docs/creating-a-fleck">`flecks.yml`</Link>
and you're rolling. Use the
[built-in tooling](https://cha0s.github.io/flecks/docs/creating-a-fleck) and you won't even have
to do that by hand. Again, **a flecks application is just flecks** having their hook
implementations invoked.

What are multiple flecks called? **flecks**!

:::tip[Flickin' fleckers]

It is not a coincidence that the name of the framework uses the same word as the plural form of
its constituting elements: the implication is that **flecks is just flecks**, it's not really doing
anything special on its own. Sure, it *does something*, but the something that it does is provide
tools with which to orchestrate your flecks together into an application.

:::

### Small core

Creating an application with `@flecks/create-app` and then doing
e.g. `yarn install --production` will result in a full working application with a size of
**less than 7 MB**. Granted, it's only a server that will start, have nothing to do, and halt in
about 100 ms, but it illustrates that flecks builds what you tell it to, **it is not a kitchen
sink system**.

</figure>

### So where's asset optimization, data fetching, filetree routing, RSC...?

Well, I do admit that I don't stand before you today with a solution for every problem around
fullstack development.

flecks is made with **cooperation and collaboration as a primary concern**. A fleck is *just
a package* exactly for that reason: it should be frictionless to publish a package (or a suite)
to the world and then add them to a project just like you would with any other package! **It should
be as frictionless** for a developer to say "I don't agree with how this fleck is
implemented" and write their own, interacting seamlessly with everything else they actually want.

**I believe we can design modular solutions to these problems!** In order to do this, it's probably
better to be standing on top of less, not more.

### <ins>Better *no* abstraction than the *wrong* abstraction</ins>

I know this will come off as inflammatory but some of the more recent JS framework "paradigms" feel
like someone <Tiny><Tiny>drunk-</Tiny></Tiny>coded at midnight and *had an epiphany* about the "killer new
thing" which means they are now going to spend the next 5 hours torturing their code only to wake
up the next morning absolutely exhausted with a rickety codebase and a deep sense of regret as they
revert all the changes and pretend that it never happened.

<figure>
  ![A picture of a person with their head down pouring coffee all over the place captioned "I'm never drinking again"](./drinking.jpg)
  <figcaption style={{fontSize: '0.8rem'}}>***obviously** this has never happened in **my** projects. <Tiny><Tiny>Also, I ran your credit card the whole time.</Tiny></Tiny>*</figcaption>
</figure>

### The flecks way

The few core architectural opinions that are held are presented as suggestions, not requirements.

:::info[**“I hold it to be the inalienable right of anybody to go to hell in his own way.”**]

― Robert Frost

:::

A few motivating philosophies which I **do not** consider to be suggestions regarding this
project:

- You **shouldn't be unpleasantly surprised** by what happens
- Your application has what **you** want in it, not what **flecks** wants in it
- Developer **comfort and confidence are essential**, not just a nice-to-have
- You **shouldn't have to have a full budget** for production deployment
- Core architectural **opinions require transparency and justification**

## Why though?

You might be thinking something like:

<figure>
  ![A screenshot of Michael from The Office shouting "NO GOD PLEASE NO"](./pls-no.jpg)
  <figcaption style={{fontSize: '0.8rem'}}>***Why?!*** *A new JavaScript framework is the last thing we need.*</figcaption>
</figure>

Perhaps you will write a thesis explaining in great detail why there is no
objective reason for flecks to exist. **I'm fine with that**,
<Tiny>because I love it and there's nothing you can do about it.</Tiny>

Seriously though, a couple reasons why I made flecks and use it to develop applications are:

### Separation of concerns

JS has matured a lot over the years, and modules are all but a first-class concept. This has been
a huge win for Properly Structured™ applications.

However, I believe the real reason many fullstack frameworks exist today is to
*centralize concerns*. No one wants to set up a whole database, a routing system, a webserver,
etc, <Tiny>etc, <Tiny>etc.</Tiny></Tiny> every time. So, the default approach has been to reach out
for a framework to tie it all together. To some extent this is an inevitable evolution.

  <figcaption style={{fontSize: '0.8rem'}}>*You've never even **seen** a real <Link target="_blank" to="https://cha0s.github.io/flecks/docs/redux">duck</Link>*</figcaption>
</figure>


With flecks, the first principle is to push these concerns out into modular units which do one
thing and do it immaculately.
[This is not a new concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)! These units can be
composed into an application that does as much or as little as you like, <Tiny>without requiring
your application structure to follow some corporate diktat <Tiny>requiring you to enter a mailing
address to submit a pull request. <Tiny>(don't ask...)</Tiny></Tiny></Tiny>

### Joy

<div style={{float: 'right', padding: '0 1.5rem'}}>![A screenshot of Marie Kondo stating "This one sparks joy."](./kondo.jpg)</div>

I have found this structure to work very well and to *feel pleasant*. It's great to get up and
running super quickly without having to repeat a monolithic structure over and over. It's almost
reminiscent of those small plastic building blocks my parents used to step on. Super fun!

I find that I **don't have to think about what flecks is doing** most of the time, which is exactly
what I want.

flecks is at its best when you can forget that it exists and everything Just Works™.

### I miss old React

One of the reasons I started using React over a decade ago was because it didn't try to dictate
every aspect of how my application was built. This new-fangled server renderin' ain't new for me
either.
[Not me casually dropping a link showing that I was messing with **SSRing Angular 1 back in 2013**](https://github.com/cha0s/shrub/commit/7573da0011cb518af460c8ef305c226144ab9603#diff-478e94fcfb7f124ddcb4782ba905316bdeac63aefc6167be56cf22829677c3bdR19).

Maybe it's irresponsible, maybe it's freewheeling (and yes, flecks (and everything) should have
more tests) but I miss that old spirit and flecks is in some small way an homage to a Better
Time™.

### Because I can

No, seriously! Over the years interacting with various parts of the JS ecosystem I have experienced
a few fairly hostile encounters with closed-minded people who lacked the imagination to see beyond
the established wisdom of the week.

So I guess anyone who told me that it won't work, doesn't make sense, or other copium-based
responses: Here it is! Eat your hearts out and
<span className="getmemedon">**haterz get meme'd on**</span>. :nail_care:

## Thanks again

I do appreciate you reading all that! I apologize if my tone came off as overly-antagonistic (as
opposed to <em>the-correct-amount-of-</em>antagonistic). I actually think people are *afraid* to say some
of the things I've said here out loud! Come send me love (or threats or whatever) at the
[Github discussions page](https://github.com/cha0s/flecks/discussions) or the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/SH66yQBwNf)!

Most importantly: **Have fun**! :heart:
