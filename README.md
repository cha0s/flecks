  <p>
    flecks is an exceptionally extensible fullstack application production system. Its true purpose
    is to make application development a more joyful endeavor. Intelligent defaults combined with
    a highly dynamic structure encourage consistency while allowing you to easily express your own
    opinions.

  ## ‚ú¥Ô∏è BE WARY ‚ú¥Ô∏è

  This is largely untested software. There are undoubtedly many bugs that haven't yet been found.
  
  I reserve the right to break all semantic versioning guarantees as long as there is a critical need for fundamental changes that significantly improve the project's architecture, performance, or address security vulnerabilities, and these modifications are deemed essential for the long-term stability, innovation, and overall betterment of the software. The project is young enough that I can get away with that. This will be revisited.
  
  **You've been warned!**

  Have fun! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

## Install

Quickly scaffold a new application monorepo:
```
yarn create @flecks/app my-new-app
```

or with `npm`:
```
npx @flecks/create-app my-new-app
```

Quickly scaffold a new fleck:
```
yarn create @flecks/fleck my-new-fleck
```

or with `npm`:
```
npx @flecks/create-fleck my-new-fleck
```

## Introduction

Modern features you expect &mdash; like

- linting
- testing
- HMR (even on server üò≥)
- SSR

Things you don't expect &mdash; like

- Dynamic CLI (hooks)
- Dynamic REPL (hooks)
- Dynamic build (include `@flecks/react` into your fleck and watch it learn to compile JSX, even on the server side)
- Freedom to split up e.g. Redux applications into discrete slices while relying on flecks to automatically handle things like middleware, reducer composition, server/localStorage hydration, etc.
- [Write a hook](packages/core/build/dox/concepts/hooks.md) and surprise someone else.

## Concepts

### Eeez vereh flecksible ü•¥

At its core, flecks is a collection of modules that use [hooks](packages/core/build/dox/concepts/hooks.md) to orchestrate everything from building your project to handling the minutia of what happens when your application starts, when a client connects, defining database models, and more.

Just to give you an idea of the power of hooks, some will be listed here:

- [`@flecks/web/server.stream.html`](https://github.com/cha0s/flecks/blob/gh-pages/hooks.md#fleckshttpserverstreamhtml)
  > Compose the server-side HTML stream. This is how SSR slides in.
- [`@flecks/docker.containers`](https://github.com/cha0s/flecks/blob/gh-pages/hooks.md#flecksdockercontainers)
  > Define [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers to automatically come up next to your app. See [`@flecks/redis`'s implementation](packages/redis/src/containers.js). `@flecks/docker` also generates `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` and provides the [CLI command](https://github.com/cha0s/flecks/blob/gh-pages/hooks.md#fleckscorecommands) `flecks docker` for even more.
- [`@flecks/web/server.request.route`](https://github.com/cha0s/flecks/blob/gh-pages/hooks.md#fleckshttpserverrequestroute)
  > Define [Express](http://expressjs.com/) middleware that runs when an HTTP route is hit.
- [... and many more on the hook reference page](https://github.com/cha0s/flecks/blob/gh-pages/hooks.md)

### The `build` directory

flecks applications contain a `build` directory with a `flecks.yml` that defines the flecks use to compose the project, as well as build-time configuration.

flecks strives to provide powerful defaults that minimize the need to override configuration.

The simplest example of a flecks server application:

```yml
'@flecks/build': {}
'@flecks/core': {}
'@flecks/server': {}
```

Yes, that's it! In fact, when you use `yarn create @flecks/app`, that's what is generated for you by default.

Obviously, this doesn't do much on its own. It simply bootstraps flecks and runs a server application with no interesting work to do. It's just a jumping-off point.
